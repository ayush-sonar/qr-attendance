# QR Attendance System for CodeCraft 2025

This project is a QR-based attendance management system developed for **CodeCraft 2025**, organized by the **CSI Committee**. The system efficiently handles participant check-ins and check-outs for multiple events using dynamically assigned QR bands.

This system was used during the event to manage participant attendance and event participation.
It worked seamlessly, providing real-time updates and participant tracking. The system was well-received by the event organizers and participants.
